# always have a version number. When we register a task definition using a name that already
# exists, AWS automatically increments the previously used version number for the task
# definition with that same name and uses it here. Note that we also define CPU and memory
# requirements here and give it a JSON file describing our task definition that I've saved
# to my repository in a aws/ directory.
